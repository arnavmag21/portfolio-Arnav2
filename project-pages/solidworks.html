          <div class="body-text">In Introduction to Detailed SolidWorks Design, the final course in the SolidWorks series at Cal Poly, I completed multiple CAD-based design projects with an emphasis on detailed, production-ready modeling. One of my main projects was the design of a bottling station, where I modeled a full mechanical assembly and focused on proper part relationships, design intent, and manufacturability. The project required going in depth on fits and tolerances, applying GD&T to critical features, and creating fully defined part and assembly drawings. In addition to the bottling station, I designed several other SolidWorks components that required careful consideration of functional requirements, constraint management, and assembly-level interactions. Through these projects, I gained experience creating detailed CAD models and drawings that clearly communicate design requirements and would be suitable for real-world manufacturing and assembly.</div>
