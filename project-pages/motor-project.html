          <div class="body-text">Project Mila is a long-term project that is still ongoing. Right now, I am working on the design of the motor cooling system. Some of my largest completed projects on the car include the inverter motor mount, wheel spacers,the front crash structure, and cooling testing procedure. Each of these projects involved both design and hands-on manufacturing, as well as integrating the parts into the vehicle.</div>
          <div class="body-text">The inverter motor mount project started by taking detailed measurements of the battery box and modeling it in SolidWorks to ensure proper fitment. After evaluating the available space in the vehicle, I decided to design a temporary motor mount using the battery box lid, as it provided the most efficient use of space. To create this temporary solution, I fabricated a custom lid out of wood. I used a table saw to cut the material into rectangular sections sized to fit over the battery box with a tight transition fit. The pieces were then assembled using drilled fastener holes, wood glue, and wood screws, resulting in a stable mounting surface for the inverter motor during early testing.</div>
          <div class="body-text">My second major project was the design and manufacture of custom wheel spacers. I first measured the motor dimensions and created a wheel spacer design in SolidWorks to match the required offsets. I then 3D printed a prototype spacer to verify fitment with the wheels and motor assembly. Once the design was confirmed, I manufactured the final spacers from aluminum stock using a water jet. The parts were finished on a lathe to remove excess material, achieve final dimensions, and improve surface finish.</div>
          <div class="body-text">My most recent completed project was assembling and installing the front crash structure. This required removing the front radiator and installing honeycomb aluminum blocks to improve energy absorption. I also cut and installed a PVC impact plate using a band saw to match the front geometry of the car.</div>
          <div class="body-text">Alongside these mechanical and manufacturing projects, I designed a cooling flow rate and pressure test procedure to evaluate the performance of the cooling system. The procedure outlines how to instrument the cooling loop with flow meters, pressure sensors, and temperature measurements, and defines baseline and performance testing at different pump speeds. It also includes leak and system integrity checks, with the goal of using the collected data to identify inefficiencies and guide future cooling system design decisions. </div>
